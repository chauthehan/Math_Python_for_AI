    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- Use `enumerate()` to get both the question number and the question\n",
    "- Use `range(len(questions))` if you prefer to access questions by index\n",
    "- Remember to convert user input to lowercase and strip spaces for comparison\n",
    "- Calculate percentage: `(score / total_questions) * 100`\n",
    "- Use if/elif/else to determine the performance message\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus Challenges** (Optional):\n",
    "- Add a \"hint\" system that gives hints for incorrect answers\n",
    "- Allow the user to skip questions (type \"skip\")\n",
    "- Add different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) with different question sets\n",
    "- Use random.shuffle() to randomize the order of questions\n"
